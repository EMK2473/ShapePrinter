## Description
OOP Lab Module: A Java program that allows users to calculate the area of various shapes including triangles, squares, trapezoids, and rectangles. The user can continuously select shapes and calculate their areas until they decide to exit the program.

## Installation Requirements
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager like Homebrew for macOS or apt-get for Linux. 

Using terminal commands: 

- Clone or download the repository: 
```Java 
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/ShapePrinter.git 
```

- Navigate to the project directory: 
```Java
- cd ShapePrinter 
```
- Compile the ShapePrinter.java file: 
```Java
- javac ShapePrinter.java 
```
- Run the program: 
```Java
- java ShapePrinter
```  

## Application Usage
The program provides options to calculate the area for four different shapes:  
```Java
Triangle 
Square 
Trapezoid 
Rectangle 
```
Examples: 
```Java
Triangle:  
Input: 1 (Selects triangle)
Followed by: Enter triangle base:  5 
Enter triangle height:  10 
Output: Area of the triangle: 25.0 
```
```Java
Square:  
Input:  2 (Selects square)
Followed by: 
Enter square length:  4 
Enter square width:  4 
Output: Area of the square is: 16.0 
```
```Java
Trapezoid:  
Input: 3 (Selects trapezoid)
Followed by: Enter trapezoid base(1):  6 
Enter trapezoid base(2):  8 
Enter trapezoid height:  5 
Output: Area of the trapezoid is: 35.0 
```
```Java
Rectangle:  
Input: 4 (Selects rectangle)
Followed by: Enter rectangle length:  7 
Enter rectangle width:  3 
Output: Area of the rectangle is: 21.0
```

This application serves a very niche purpose and is not easily modified to fufill any other application purpose.
